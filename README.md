Betty is a dynamic programming language designed for prototyping purposes. It supports various data types, has a standard library, and offers a simple and intuitive syntax. For more information, please refer to the [official Betty documentation](https://betty-lang.github.io/betty-docs/).

## Quick Start

> 📝 No binaries are currently supplied for the Betty interpreter, as it is still a work-in-progress. In the future, a GitHub Actions automated workflow for release builds is likely to be set up.

Currently, the fastest way to get started with development in Betty is to clone the repo and build the binaries yourself.
